# Open Space Technolog-ists
wants to be a specific OST for Tecnologists, specifically in the software development and scaleup environment.

The idea is to gather 4-6 developers, from 4-6 companies, to reach a number of 20-30 partecipants.

I wan't get into the detail of OST, but the value of attending as a Team is thet you bring the value of knowledge sharing to an stronger level, more interlaced.  
It's not just like having one member read a book and try to evangelize it, or either attending an event and then not being able to summarize what he/she learned and refer it to the team.  
By attending to Open Space Technologists a team will bring his shared knowledge, will then mix with several teams, interact, exchange point of views and then bring back a stronger set of enriched point of views.  
The event won't be forgotten just two days before.
